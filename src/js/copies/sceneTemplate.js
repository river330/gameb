/**
 * sceneTemplate.js
 *
 * this is an example of a scene module
 *
 * scene modules split a p5 sketch up into different scenes. each scene
 * is like a partial p5 sketch with its own preload(), setup(), draw(), etc
 *
 * scenes help organize complex code by encapsulating related state and code
 * into isolated modules.
 *
 * since scenes are in modules, they don't share variables unless explicitedly
 * exported and imported.
 *
 * scene modules provide several "lifecycle" functions that are called
 * by main.js at important times.
 *
 * only one scene is "active" at a time. the active scene receives
 * update() and draw() calls and event calls like mousePressed()
 *

// preload
// called once from the main preload()
// use this to load any assets you need for the scene
export function preload() {}

// setup
// called once from the main setup()
// *one time* code that SHOULD NOT rerun every time the scene is entered
export function setup() {}

// enter
// called from changeScene() when this scene is entered
// code that SHOULD rerun every time the scene is entered
export function enter() {}

// update
// called from the main draw() loop
// code that updates the state of the scene (changes variables)
// should NOT have draw code in it
export function update() {}

// draw
// called from the main draw() loop
// code that draws the scene
// should NOT have update code in it
export function draw() {}

// mousePressed
// called from the main mousePressed() function
// code that handles mousePressed events
export function mousePressed() {}

// exit
// called from changeScene() when this scene is exited
// code that SHOULD run every time the scene is exited
export function exit() {}
